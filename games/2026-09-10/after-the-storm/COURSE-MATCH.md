# Original course matching — active work

Goal: match the original Wave Race 64 courses, including recognisable geography,
buoy arrangements, obstacles, race ramps, alternate paths and lap changes.
The previous PARITY.md only established broad gameplay systems. It does **not**
prove this course-matching goal. None of the nine courses is signed off yet.

Illustrated maps are inspection references in work/course-reference; they are
not shipped game textures. World distances are reconstruction estimates.
The four difficulty pages have been retrieved, and all eight Reverse diagrams,
all six Normal diagrams, plus Expert City/Glacier and Hard/Expert Beach inspected.
Remaining diagrams still require inspection before their buoy layouts are authored.

## Course requirements and current state

| Course | Distinctive requirements | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sunny Beach | Long sandbar, parallel straights, tight ends, open sea and mainland, difficulty-specific slalom | Rebuilt geography; exact buoy placements and visual sign-off pending |
| Sunset Bay | L-shaped landmass, orange water, race jump, piers and bypass choices | Rebuilt island/route and race ramp; piers, bypasses and buoy placement pending |
| Drake Lake | Irregular square loop, small island, fog clearing, posts, slowing weeds | Rebuilt banks/island, posts and wet-hull weed resistance; route/visual checks pending |
| Marine Fortress | Storm, fortress-shaped shoreline, crates, lap-dependent gate | Existing generic course; full reconstruction pending |
| Port Blue | Tanker, working dock, winding narrow tunnel and outer route | Existing generic course; full reconstruction pending |
| Twilight City | Angular urban channel, walls, race ramps and alternate routes | Existing generic course; full reconstruction pending |
| Glacier Coast | Constricted coast, ice ramps/sliding, breakable ice hazards | Existing generic course; full reconstruction pending |
| Southern Island | Connected islands/piers, dropping water, exposed ship and changing routes | Existing generic course; full reconstruction pending |
| Dolphin Park | Enclosed basin, kidney island, two main ramps, jetties and tunnel | Existing generic course; full reconstruction pending |

Each course requires visual comparison, ordinary-input traversal on all classes,
actual obstacle/ramp/shortcut interactions, and regression checks for stunts and
split-screen. Passing navigation alone is insufficient. Existing record keys also
need layout revisions so old course times cannot compete with reconstructed ones.

Do not publish or declare course parity from this initial geography pass.

## First geography milestone — September 10, 2026

- Sunny Beach, Sunset Bay and Drake Lake now use explicit authored shorelines and route shapes in classic-courses.js. Legacy internal IDs are retained for compatibility; record revision handling remains outstanding.
- Sunset's ramp is available in race modes, with a navigable outer bypass. Drake's eight posts retain collisions; wet hulls lose speed in the same elliptical weed patches rendered by the scene.
- New checks cover land/water cross-sections, L-shaped geography, race-ramp presence, continuous route clearance and actual weed drag. An additional collision test covers escape from a post overlap.
- Full suite: 110/110 passed in 67.05 seconds. After adding the last overlap test, all five focused reconstruction tests passed; 111 distinct checks are covered. No runtime code changed after the full run.
- Browser Sunny Beach / Normal / chop: 161.733 seconds, 72 gates, zero misses, nine landings. Sunset Bay / Normal / chop: 246.900 seconds, 72 gates, zero misses, two landings. Both finished second; High graphics and 60 FPS in final measurement windows. Runtime error logs were empty.
- Browser Drake Lake / Expert / venue conditions: 186.617 seconds, 96 gates, zero misses, no wave landings, second place. High graphics, final 60 FPS; runtime error log empty.
- First inspection confirmed the sandbar/mainland separation and L-shaped minimap, with reflected coast and the race jump. Final scenery, pier collision, original buoy patterns and water palette matching are still required.

This milestone is local only. Production still serves the previous completed gameplay release.
