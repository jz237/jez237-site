// ===========================================================================
// 5.4 FIGHT NIGHT — THE DEMO'S CAMERA AND CADENCE DIRECTOR (sweep #7 / #17).
//
// The attract show had no camera and no tempo. Measured on the 5.4 head
// (headless Chrome, 1920x1080, ?demo=237 on the wall clock, 175 s sampled at
// 100 ms): 95% of fight-phase frames sat at presentation zoom exactly 1.00,
// the only demo-conditional framing made the shot WIDER (the 0.86 pull-back,
// the 3D camera's 1.12 cap), and every tick of every round ran at the same
// 0.75x — footsies and the round-ending hit passed at one speed. From a couch
// a super, a counter and a KO all looked like the same locked wide shot.
//
// This module is the pure half of the fix: a SEEDED SHOT LIST for the two
// set pieces the sim already produces (the super wind-up and the KO hit) and
// a TEMPO-AWARE CADENCE POLICY (1x while both fighters are free and out of
// range, 0.75x once anyone swings or the pair is inside contact range, a
// slow-motion beat on the round-ending hit, 0.75x for the ceremony). game.js
// owns the wiring; renderer/three/camera.mjs reads the same beat to lift its
// demo punch-in cap. None of it touches the sim:
//
//   * every shot is a PRESENTATION envelope composed into the existing
//     cinematicCamera pose (zoom about a focus point, a dutch degree or two),
//     the same primitives the KO punch-in and the intro dolly already use;
//   * the slow-motion beat rides engine/demo-speed.mjs — a tick CADENCE
//     multiplier, never a dt change — so the tick stream a seed produces is
//     bit-identical with or without the beat (pinned in
//     tests/demo-camera.test.mjs and by the demo-seed-url smoke probe);
//   * the shot draw is a seeded shuffle bag (the director's refillBag, so no
//     variant ever repeats back to back) whose only inputs are the demo seed
//     and the ORDER of the events the tick stream produces — the same seed
//     replays the same shots at the same ticks.
//
// Every game.js call site is gated on the demo session (state.mode ===
// "demo" && demoSession.active), so a played match is byte-identical.
