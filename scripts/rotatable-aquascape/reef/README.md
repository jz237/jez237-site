# Living Reef — first 3D preview

Separate reef option built from the current jez237 planted aquarium renderer.
The reference supplied September 22 guides the two islands, archways, white sand
channel, corals, anemones and fish palette. All scenery and inhabitants have 3D
volume; the reference image is not used as a scene background.

**Publication boundary:** jez237.com and jz237/jez237-site only. Do not add the reef
option to Hidden Reef until the user approves its realism. The planted aquarium
and its shared freshwater biology/chemistry bundles are unchanged.

## Develop and build

- `npm run dev:reef` — local preview at port 5240.
- `npm run build:reef` — type-check, build and copy to `demos/reef-aquarium/`.
- `npm run check:reef` — browser behavior, controls, collision and mobile checks.
  Inspect `reef/qa/front.png`, `angle.png` and `mobile.png` before releasing.

The small jez237-only selector is maintained by `scripts/reef_navigation.mjs`.
Shared aquarium rebuilds preserve it without adding it to either Hidden Reef copy.

## Current visual pass

Irregular forked coral with rounded growth tips, rock-attached bases, closed thin
plate skeletons, and procedural limestone albedo/normal/roughness maps. The QA
run includes coral and anemone close-ups for checking tissue detail as well as full views.
Anemones have continuous rounded skin, a rock-anchored column and oral disc,
individual curved tentacles, and root-to-tip GPU deformation shared across views.
A geometry check guards against inward-facing tentacle surfaces.

Basic anemone anatomy is informed by the [National Aquarium](https://aqua.org/explore/animals/anemones)
and [Oregon Coast Aquarium](https://aquarium.org/animals/bubble-tip-anemone/).
The reference guides the artistic appearance; flow and tissue shading are illustrative,
not a species-calibrated fluid or subsurface-scattering simulation.

## Rendering and behavior

Shared water, glass, contact shading, adaptive effects and reflection scheduling.
Merged coral/rock geometry, instanced rubble and food, generated cached materials,
GPU body waves and soft-tentacle deformation. Full geometry stays present at every
effects tier. Auto lowers expensive optical effects only after sustained slow frames.
Fish maintain individual goals and speed variation, loose species association,
separation, swept obstacle tests, stable upright turns and actual food consumption.
Clownfish stay near their anemone. Pause freezes biological time. Freshwater assets
are not loaded by the reef and the reef is not loaded by the planted aquarium.

Behavior rates and the mixed display are illustrative, not experimentally calibrated
species measurements or a tank stocking recommendation. Collisions use conservative
volumes rather than triangle-perfect anatomical contact. Further work: more accurate
species anatomy/textures, detailed polyp tissue, indirect reef lighting and improved
local routing through tight spaces. This first preview is not yet photographic parity
with the supplied reference or the mature planted aquarium.
